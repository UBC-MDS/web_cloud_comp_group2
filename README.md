## Summary 
In this lab, we will be working on working on this [dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) to get exposure to working with large datasets. We will be building and deploying ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~12 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation. The resulting ML model will be deployed in cloud for others to use.
