    "You probably got how to set up primary URL endpoints from the ```sampleproject.ipynb notebook``` and have them process and return some data. Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",

    "Milestone 1 -4 introduces us to a complete framework of how to take advantage of APIs, advanced python packages, cloud computing tools to build and deploy the machine learning models based on large datasets. It also allows us to have some hands-on experience starting with using the API to download large data to the very end of deploying our own API as a data science group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be specific, our summaries and main findings for each millstone are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In milestone 1, we found that downloading and wrangling with large datasets locally was not only inefficient, but also infeasible for some group members due to its large memory and storage requirement.  Using DASK or loading data in chucks can be solutions, but still not very ideal. In this milestone, we also got a chance to compare and work with file formats that can be useful in big data processing such as `parquet` and `feather`.\n",
    "- In milestone 2, we transferred from the local machines to the AWS, including setting up our EC2 instance for running JupyterHub and S3 bucket for cloud data storage. We found that creating and configuring those things requires lots of time and debugging efforts, but processing big data becomes both feasible and much faster once they are settled.\n",
    "- In milestone 3, we set up our EMR clusters and trained the machine learning model with both MLlib and sklearn. We are impressed by how easy and efficient we can use Spark engine to implement a machine learning pipeline through spark's MLlib library.\n",
    "- In milestone 4, we deployed our machine learning model as an API based on the web framework using Flask. We thought that this type of deployment makes our model becomes more convenient to use, since users do not need to look at any source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our opinion, everything all we did in these milestone projects is very practical and useful, especially all of the AWS experiences. We believe that it will serve as good guidance for what we will do in our future jobs. In addition, as we were following the instructions of the milestones and working as a team, it also reminds us that while working and sharing resources in the cloud environment, it important to check and ensure that every team member could access the EC2 server, EMR cluster, JupyterHub, and data resources properly (if team members are sharing the same server/cluster). For example, in milestone2, we did not notice that we were not giving everyone the writing access to the JupyterHub on EC2, which took us a long time to debug later on.\n"
